Telco Customer Churn – Summary Insights

This analysis combines SQL, Python, and Power BI to understand who churns, why they churn, and the financial impact of churn.
The findings follow a logical progression from overall churn, to drivers, to risk identification.

⸻

1. Overall Churn Landscape
	•	Overall churn rate: ~26.6%
	•	Churn is not evenly distributed; it is concentrated in specific customer segments and early tenure.

⸻

2. When Do Customers Churn?
	•	Early churn is dominant:
	•	0–6 months: ~53% churn
	•	Churn steadily decreases as tenure increases.
	•	Average tenure:
	•	Churned customers: ~18 months
	•	Retained customers: ~38 months

Insight: The first 6 months are the most critical retention window.

3. Strongest Churn Drivers (Categorical)

Across SQL validation and Python (Cramér’s V):

High-impact drivers
	•	Contract type:
	•	Month-to-month customers churn at ~43%
	•	Payment method:
	•	Electronic check churns at ~45% (highest of all methods)
	•	Internet service:
	•	Fiber optic users churn at ~42%
	•	Support & security:
	•	No TechSupport → ~42% churn
	•	No OnlineSecurity → ~42% churn

Low-impact / weak drivers
	•	Phone service
	•	Number of lines
	•	Some add-ons (moderate effect only)

Insight: Churn is driven more by service type, contract flexibility, and lack of support/security than by basic phone features.

⸻

4. Spending Behavior of Churners
	•	Churners:
	•	Pay more per month
	•	Generate lower total revenue due to short tenure
	•	Avg comparison:
	•	MonthlyCharges: higher for churners
	•	TotalCharges: significantly lower for churners

Insight: High monthly price alone doesn’t cause churn — short tenure is the real value killer.

⸻

5. High-Risk Customer Segments

A clear high-risk segment emerges repeatedly:

Month-to-month + Electronic check + Fiber optic

	•	~60% churn rate
	•	Large enough segment to matter commercially

Insight: This segment represents the most immediate churn risk and retention opportunity.

⸻

6. Risk Scoring Validation

A SQL-based risk score was built using key churn drivers.

Findings:
	•	Customers with higher risk scores churn significantly more.
	•	Removing MonthlyCharges from the score improved model performance (validated via AUC).
	•	Final score focuses on behavioral and service-related drivers, not raw price.

Insight: Simple, interpretable risk scoring is effective when features are carefully selected.

⸻

7. Revenue Impact
	•	Avg revenue lost per churner: ~$1,530
	•	Monthly revenue at risk (high-risk customers): ~$168K

Insight: Even small churn reductions in high-risk segments can yield meaningful revenue gains.

⸻

Final Business Takeaways
	1.	Churn happens early — retention efforts must focus on the first 6 months.
	2.	Month-to-month, fiber optic, and electronic check customers are the highest risk.
	3.	Support and security add-ons matter more than price alone.
	4.	Risk scoring works best when redundant price signals are removed.
	5.	Targeted interventions in a few key segments can significantly reduce churn and revenue loss.
